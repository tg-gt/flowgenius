Perfect! I can see you have an Obsidian plugin template already set up. Creating a PRD is absolutely the right approach for this project. Let me help you create a comprehensive PRD that aligns with your FlowGenius project requirements.

## Product Requirements Document: Immersive Writing Environment Plugin for Obsidian

### 1. **Project Overview**

**Plugin Name:** FlowGenius Writer (or ImmersiveVault)

**Problem Statement:** Writing in Obsidian's plain white/dark backgrounds can feel sterile and disconnected from the content being created. Writers often need environmental cues to maintain creative flow and immersion in their subject matter.

**Solution:** An AI-powered Obsidian plugin that dynamically generates and animates contextual backgrounds based on your writing, creating an immersive environment that adapts to your content in real-time.

### 2. **Core Features**

1. **Context Extraction**
   - Extract content from active note
   - Support for custom instructions/mood settings
   - Intelligent summarization for prompt creation

2. **AI Prompt Generation**
   - Use OpenAI to create optimized image generation prompts
   - Context-aware prompt enhancement
   - Style and mood interpretation

3. **Image Generation**
   - Replicate API integration for image creation
   - Support for multiple models (Stable Diffusion, SDXL, etc.)
   - Caching system to avoid redundant generation

4. **Animation System**
   - Subtle Ken Burns effect (pan/zoom)
   - Fade transitions between images
   - Performance-optimized CSS animations

5. **Background Integration**
   - Seamless Obsidian theme integration
   - Opacity controls for readability
   - Per-vault or per-note settings

### 3. **Technical Architecture**

```typescript
// Key Components
1. ContentAnalyzer - Extracts and processes note content
2. PromptGenerator - Creates image prompts via OpenAI
3. ImageGenerator - Handles Replicate API calls
4. AnimationEngine - Manages background animations
5. BackgroundManager - Integrates with Obsidian's rendering
6. WorkflowOrchestrator - LangGraph/n8n integration
```

### 4. **Workflow Integration (LangGraph/n8n)**

To meet project requirements, we'll use **LangGraph** for intelligent workflow orchestration:

- **Content Analysis Workflow**: Multi-step analysis of note content
- **Generation Pipeline**: Orchestrate prompt → image → animation flow
- **Background Update Logic**: Smart triggers for when to update backgrounds
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent caching and API call optimization

### 5. **User Settings**

```typescript
interface ImmersiveWriterSettings {
    openaiApiKey: string;
    replicateApiKey: string;
    updateFrequency: 'manual' | 'onSave' | 'realtime';
    animationStyle: 'subtle' | 'dynamic' | 'static';
    opacity: number; // 0.1 - 0.5
    imageStyle: string; // "photorealistic", "artistic", "abstract"
    customInstructions: string;
    enabledFolders: string[]; // Specific folders to enable
}
```

### 6. **Development Roadmap**

#### **Day 1 (Monday) - Foundation & Planning**
- [ ] Finalize PRD and technical decisions
- [ ] Set up enhanced Obsidian plugin structure
- [ ] Implement basic settings UI
- [ ] Create API integration scaffolding
- [ ] Attend LangGraph class and plan workflow integration

#### **Day 2 (Tuesday) - Core Functionality**
- [ ] Implement content extraction from notes
- [ ] Build OpenAI prompt generation
- [ ] Create Replicate API integration
- [ ] Basic background injection into Obsidian
- [ ] **Early Submission Target**: Working prototype that can generate and display a background

#### **Day 3 (Wednesday) - Animation & Polish**
- [ ] Implement CSS animation system
- [ ] Add transition effects
- [ ] Create caching mechanism
- [ ] Integrate LangGraph workflows
- [ ] Performance optimization

#### **Day 4 (Thursday) - Final Polish**
- [ ] Complete settings interface
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Create demo video
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] **Final Submission**: Complete, polished plugin

### 7. **Technical Decisions**

1. **State Management**: Use Obsidian's built-in settings and cache API
2. **Animation Approach**: CSS animations for performance (no canvas)
3. **Image Storage**: Local caching with periodic cleanup
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement queuing system with LangGraph
5. **Background Rendering**: CSS injection into Obsidian's workspace

### 8. **Success Metrics**

- Background updates within 5 seconds of trigger
- Smooth animations with no frame drops
- < 5% CPU usage during idle animation
- Cached images reduce API calls by 80%
- User can write uninterrupted with enhanced immersion

### 9. **Risk Mitigation**

- **API Costs**: Implement aggressive caching and rate limiting
- **Performance**: Use CSS animations, lazy loading, and debouncing
- **Readability**: Careful opacity controls and blur effects
- **Compatibility**: Test with popular Obsidian themes

This PRD gives us a clear roadmap and can be updated as we progress. The modular architecture will make it perfect for AI-assisted development in Cursor!
