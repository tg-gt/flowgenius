BrainLift: FlowGenius – Immersive Writing Backgrounds for Obsidian
1. SpikyPOV 🔪💡
“The ambient canvas matters as much as the text.
Traditional note apps treat the page as an inert rectangle; we treat it as an adaptive, AI-driven mood board that tunes a writer’s cognition in real time.”
99 % of tools optimize fonts & syntax, ignoring the sub-perceptual cues that influence focus and flow.
AI image models finally let us bend ambience to the writer instead of vice-versa.
By fusing content analysis + generative imagery, we can turn every note into a miniature “Holodeck scene” that amplifies creativity, memory and emotional resonance.
2. Origin Story / Intention
Personal itch – writing in a white/black void feels sterile; background playlists and scented candles help, so why can’t the software?
Tech timing – Stable Diffusion, SDXL & Replicate give sub-5-second local image generation; LangGraph lets us pipeline analysis → prompt → image without hand-rolled state machines.
Leverage existing obsession – I already spend hours in Obsidian; adding ambience raises usage happiness every single day.
Future optionality – Same pipeline can power per-paragraph images, cover art, slide decks, etc.
3. Hypotheses to Validate
H1. Dynamic, context-matched backgrounds measurably increase writing session length & satisfaction.
H2. Two-step Smart Prompt Workflow (LangGraph) improves perceived image relevance > 50 % vs. naïve single prompt.
H3. Manual trigger (button) avoids distraction better than automatic updates during typing.
7. Risks & Mitigations
Flicker / distraction – keep update frequency manual (MVP) → optional “on save” later.
API cost spiral – per-vault cache & key ownership by user.
Readability – default opacity 0.25 + radial dark-to-transparent overlay.
Theme conflicts – inject via body.flow-genius-active to isolate styles.
8. Success Criteria (MVP)
User can generate background in ≤ 10 s with one click.
Background persists across vault reload.
CPU < 5 % during idle pan/zoom animation.
≥ 80 % of test prompts rated “relevant” (≥ 4 / 5).
9. North-Star Vision
A fully adaptive writing environment that:
Detects focus loss & subtly shifts ambience back to “flow”.
Learns personal aesthetic over time (reinforcement from manual thumbs-up).
Exports snapshots of note + background as shareable micro-stories.
Opens API for other plugins to request thematic imagery (e.g., task boards, daily reviews).
